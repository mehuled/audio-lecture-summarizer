# audio-lecture-summarizer
This is my first project on ML, in which we created a simple lecture recorder and then using CMU Sphinx generated a text transcript which was further used to create a summary of the recorded lecture and also generate a webpage carrying the summary and transcript.

I am gonna work on it accuracy of generation of summary to quantatively show how it can be enhanced over time.
